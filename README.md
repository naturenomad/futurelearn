# futurelearn

Exercises from futurelearn training courses (https://www.futurelearn.com).

Wellcome Genome Campus Advanced Courses and Scientific Conferences run a free course - Bioinformatics for Biologists - on the futurelearn site, which covers linux, bash and R skills relevant for bioinformatics tasks. This is useful as a linux/bash refresher and introduction to visualising data using R, as well as a little further exposure to working with genomics data.

Any shell- and R- exercises worth uploading to github will be included in this repo.
